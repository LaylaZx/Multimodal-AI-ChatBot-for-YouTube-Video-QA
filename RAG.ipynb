So what we're gonna do is look at why doing lots of practice tests is a terrible idea. In fact, this is the worst thing you could do. If you think that just doing lots and lots and lots of practice tests is gonna help you get a higher score, you are wrong. But what then I'm gonna show you is three better ways to practice that will actually improve your scores because at the end of the day, what are we doing? We're helping you improve your scores. So we're only gonna teach you the things that work and make you aware of the things that don't work. And these three ways are totally free and you can do them at home by yourself without a teacher. So they're absolutely brilliant. So number one, why doing lots of practice tests is a terrible idea. Well, the first thing is they're boring. So our brains like to do things that they enjoy. And if they're doing things that they find pleasurable, then our brains are going to be able to absorb that information and learn from it. Also, we're human beings. If we're doing something that is really, really boring, it is a very low likelihood that we are going to continue doing that thing and consistently doing it. And really the key for all aspects of IELTS is doing things consistently over a relatively long period of time. You cannot cram for the IELTS test the week before or a month before. What you need to be doing is doing a little bit of work every single day over a long period of time because listening is a skill and we want to improve that skill and that will help us improve our scores. Number two, no improvement. The analogy I always use for this is, could you learn how to drive a car and pass your driving test by going on a racetrack and just going around and around and around and around and around in a car? No, you would pick up really bad habits and you wouldn't really learn what you're doing wrong and what you're doing right. Just practising is not actually going to help you improve, especially when it comes to the IELTS listening test. You might be doing test after test after test and spending a lot of time doing that but not seeing any improvement. So we obviously want to spend time on things that enable us to improve our scores and ignore things that don't actually lead to improvement. And it's a really strange thing and it's a really attractive thing to think that you're working hard. So you're doing all of these tests and you're telling yourself I'm doing all this hard work and doing something that is helping me when really in the back of your mind you know that it's not really helping. Number three is really, really important. You're not getting any feedback. You're just doing practise tests. You're not actually learning from your mistakes. And the only way to learn is for someone to help you with that. And I'm gonna show you a way that you can learn from your own mistakes without even the need of a teacher. It's great if you have a teacher with you but obviously due to money and due to the fact that you might live in a place that doesn't have great teachers, you want to be able to give yourself feedback and learn from your own mistakes. And all of this is going to lead to frustration. You wouldn't believe the number of emails that people send me saying, you know, I've done every single practise test in the world and I keep getting 6.5. We get those every single day. And what happens when you are frustrated because it's boring, you're not improving, you're not seeing any progression, you're gonna get frustrated, you're gonna give up. If you give up, you are guaranteeing a low score because you're just not going to do the test or you're going to go into the test not prepared and you're gonna get nervous and stressed out because you know you're going to fail. So we don't want to do this. We don't want to do practise test after practise test. Let's look at three ways that actually do help you improve your listening skills and help you improve your IELTS test performance and help you improve your scores. So there are three better ways. Number one, listen for pleasure. Number two, listen actively. And number three, listen reflectively. So let's go into detail on each of these and find out how you can practically do these at home by yourself for free without a teacher. So number one, listen for pleasure. As we've already talked about, you need to do something that you enjoy so that you will do it consistently. Listening is a skill. The more you do it, the better you're going to become at it. So if you are listening to things that you enjoy, then you're going to do this consistently. It seems pretty obvious, but not many students think of it that way. I think maybe because it's studying and a lot of people think that studying should be boring and studying should be laborious. It doesn't have to be. And the great thing about all of these, so podcasts, TV, movies, radio, TED Talks, YouTube, real people. Apart from real people, all of these are in the palm of your hand. They're on your phone. You can listen to podcasts on anything in the world, or YouTube, or TED Talks, or radio, or movies, or TV even on your phone. There is an unlimited supply of listening material out there for you. And the great thing about all this choice and the fact that we can get everything at the touch of a button is that whatever you are interested in, there's a podcast on it. Whatever you are interested in, there's a YouTube channel or multiple hundreds of YouTube channels on that. There's probably a radio show about it. There's probably TED Talks on it. So I've dealt with students who were really into cricket. Listened to cricket matches and commentators discussing the match. I've had students who were really into cookery programs. Listened to a cookery podcast. I've had students who really loved sci-fi movies. Listened to a sci-fi movie, or listened to a sci-fi podcast, or listened to a sci-fi YouTube channel where they discuss the movies. It doesn't matter what you're into, there's something there for you. And also the great thing about having everything on your phone is you can do it at any time. So that 10 minutes before you get out of bed, or those 30 minutes on the bus on the way to work, or the 20 minutes you have during your lunch break where you're not doing anything, there are unlimited number of options, and there are a huge number of opportunities for you to practise that. None of these are IELTS related, but remember, they're not testing your ability to answer IELTS questions. They're testing your ability. Does this person have a requisite skill level to get a band seven, or a band eight, or a band nine? In other words, when you go to live in England, or live in America or Canada, will you be able to understand what is going on? Will you be able to understand what people are saying? And also, real people, if you are around native English speakers, listen to them if you want to improve your listening. Number two, listen actively. Okay, so listen, there's a difference between listening passively. So listening passively is just sitting on the bus, looking out the window, listening to a podcast, and not really thinking about it. Now, that's better than nothing, but it is better to actively focus on one, maximum two things while you're listening to that podcast, or that TV show, or that movie, or that YouTube video. Focus on one thing at a time, for example, vocabulary, accent, intonation, multiple speakers, and normally focus on the thing that you really need help with. So let's say that you find out that you really need help with your vocabulary. Then when you're listening to a podcast and you hear a new word, note that new word down. Guess what that word means from the context. Note down all the information you need to remember that word, such as meaning, synonyms, antonyms, collocations, sentences, pronunciation, all of these things. And then in a few weeks, a few months, you will have a vocabulary book just full of new words that you have learned. You should be doing that with reading as well. Or let's say you have a problem with the Scottish accent, or the Irish accent, or the Australian accent. Listen to a podcast where there are those accents and listen for words that you don't really understand. Listen again, listen again, until you figure out what that word is, or intonation. What you can do is, let's say you're watching a movie, look at the movie script, or look at the subtitles, and guess what the intonation is going to be like, and then compare it with how the actor says it, and then mimic what they say. Or listening to multiple speakers, and how they take turns and interrupt each other, and how they give signposting language on what they're doing. There are multiple things that you can focus on, and you should just focus on your weaknesses, really. So you can see the difference between that and just sitting on the bus, looking out the window, listening to whatever. Actively do something, and that, again, is going to give you a lot more bang for your buck in terms of, you know, if you spend 20 minutes actively listening to a podcast focusing on vocabulary, you might get 10 or 20 words out of that, and that's going to help you in not only your listening test, but your speaking test, your reading test, your writing test, or just look out the window for 20 minutes and think that you're improving when really you're not. So active listening is really, really important. This is probably the.\\n\\n## IELTS_Listening_Practice__What_You_NEED_to_Know_chunk_1.mp3\\nimportant one in terms of improving your IELTS scores is listen reflectively. So this is when you do practice tests. So you get a practice test make sure it's a real genuine practice test. Do not use these fake tests that you'll find online. They're only there so that they can they can get clicks on their website. 90% over 90% of practice tests you'll find online are fake tests. They're not made by Cambridge. The only tests you should use are the Cambridge tests and because they're created by the people who create the test and they know what they're doing. So what you do is you do the test under exam conditions and then honestly honestly evaluate your mistakes. Where did you go wrong? And think about why did you get each question wrong. So was it spelling? Was it timing? Was it meaning? Was it vocabulary? Was it strategy? Was it spelling? What was it? And write down beside each one the key reason why you got that question wrong. And don't just look at it and be like I don't know why I got it wrong. Actually think about it. If you think about it you will figure out why you got that question wrong. Was it because you were unfamiliar with the question types or maybe you're getting a certain question type wrong every single time. And what you'll see if you do let's say three or four practice tests you'll start to see patterns emerging. Normally students are getting a lower score not because they're bad at everything but because there's one or two things that they need to work on. So I was working with a student recently who was great. Their listening was amazing and but they kept getting 6.5 and the only reason for that was their spelling. Because if you spell look what you know if you spell the answer wrong it's wrong it doesn't and they kept saying oh but it's nearly right. I'm like no they're not going to see it that way. So they worked on their spelling and they improved and they got the score they needed. I've worked with multiple students who had difficulties with particular types of questions. For example on the reading test and a lot of students have problems with true false not given and matching headings questions. So if you see a pattern emerging there focus on that question learn how to do that question and get a strategy for that question and then you're going to improve. The key here is you need to take action. So once you see this pattern emerging let's say you notice that vocabulary is your problem and you keep messing up because you just don't understand what the words mean and you don't understand the synonyms of the of the words that you're looking for. If you just say okay better luck next time then you've just wasted your time and you're going to fail next time. But if you take action on that and improve that then you are really really going to see results. So don't do lots of practice tests listen to something you enjoy focus on particular things when you're listening and reflect on your mistakes notice patterns and take action on that and that goes around in that feedback loop. So let's say for example you again focused on this and realized that vocabulary was a problem actively listen and focus on vocabulary. Get yourself a podcast or a YouTube channel on something you enjoy and try and improve your vocabulary through listening to something you enjoy and therefore you're really going to enjoy what you're doing you're going to improve and then get the score you need. Sounds simple but it actually does really really work. Thank you very much guys hope that you enjoyed that video.\\n\\n\")"

So what we're gonna do is look at why doing lots of practice tests is a terrible idea. In fact, this is the worst thing you could do. If you think that just doing lots and lots and lots of practice tests is gonna help you get a higher score, you are wrong. But what then I'm gonna show you is three better ways to practice that will actually improve your scores because at the end of the day, what are we doing? We're helping you improve your scores. So we're only gonna teach you the things that work and make you aware of the things that don't work. And these three ways are totally free and you can do them at home by yourself without a teacher. So they're absolutely brilliant. So number one, why doing lots of practice tests is a terrible idea. Well, the first thing is they're boring. So our brains like to do things that they enjoy.

So our brains like to do things that they enjoy. And if they're doing things that they find pleasurable, then our brains are going to be able to absorb that information and learn from it. Also, we're human beings. If we're doing something that is really, really boring, it is a very low likelihood that we are going to continue doing that thing and consistently doing it. And really the key for all aspects of IELTS is doing things consistently over a relatively long period of time. You cannot cram for the IELTS test the week before or a month before. What you need to be doing is doing a little bit of work every single day over a long period of time because listening is a skill and we want to improve that skill and that will help us improve our scores. Number two, no improvement. The analogy I always use for this is, could you learn how to drive a car and pass your driving test by going on a racetrack and just going around and around and around and\"),\n",

No, you would pick up really bad habits and you wouldn't really learn what you're doing wrong and what you're doing right. Just practising is not actually going to help you improve, especially when it comes to the IELTS listening test. You might be doing test after test after test and spending a lot of time doing that but not seeing any improvement. So we obviously want to spend time on things that enable us to improve our scores and ignore things that don't actually lead to improvement. And it's a really strange thing and it's a really attractive thing to think that you're working hard. So you're doing all of these tests and you're telling yourself I'm doing all this hard work and doing something that is helping me when really in the back of your mind you know that it's not really helping.

It's great if you have a teacher with you but obviously due to money and due to the fact that you might live in a place that doesn't have great teachers, you want to be able to give yourself feedback and learn from your own mistakes. And all of this is going to lead to frustration. You wouldn't believe the number of emails that people send me saying, you know, I've done every single practise test in the world and I keep getting 6.5. We get those every single day.

So we don't want to do this. We don't want to do practise test after practise test. Let's look at three ways that actually do help you improve your listening skills and help you improve your IELTS test performance and help you improve your scores. So there are three better ways. Number one, listen for pleasure. Number two, listen actively. And number three, listen reflectively. So let's go into detail on each of these and find out how you can practically do these at home by yourself for free without a teacher. So number one, listen for pleasure.

It seems pretty obvious, but not many students think of it that way. I think maybe because it's studying and a lot of people think that studying should be boring and studying should be laborious. It doesn't have to be. And the great thing about all of these, so podcasts, TV, movies, radio, TED Talks, YouTube, real people. Apart from real people, all of these are in the palm of your hand.

Listened to a cookery podcast. I've had students who really loved sci-fi movies.

In other words, when you go to live in England, or live in America or Canada, will you be able to understand what is going on? Will you be able to understand what people are saying?

There is lots of words to substitute for say. One that you can almost always paraphrase with is claim. Let's look at the sentence. The economist said that prices would rise. Here's claim. The economist claimed that prices would rise. Another common word for reporting what someone said is talk about. It's used for a general subject, not a specific idea.

The professor is recommending something, right? She's making a suggestion. You can change recommend to advocate. Note that advocate is followed by a noun or an idea starting with an ing verb like this. The teacher recommends studying. This changes to the teacher advocates studying. This word is very advanced. If you use it correctly, it will boost your score like this. While I'm talking about ways to say something, I should mention explain about. Let's look at the sentence.

You may end up using give a lot too. Like my sister gave me her bike when I moved into my own apartment. Give works well. If you want a polite word, you can also say offer. My sister offered me her bike when I moved into my own apartment. There is a slight difference. Give means you took the bike, but offer does not. It's implied that you did, unless you add more details. For example, my sister offered me her bike, but I already had one. That means she tried to give you the bike, but you said no.

Speaking of easy, this word can be paraphrased too. What word should you use? Simple is the same as easy. You can change what an easy way to show off your vocabulary to what a simple way to show off your vocabulary. I want to mention one other thing about IELTS writing though. If you go back and change a word, be sure that you change the words around it too. Note that an easy way doesn't become a simple way. You have to change the n to a. So be careful.

If you make spelling mistakes, your band score goes down. That's why it's super important to pay attention to spelling. One more phrase we use a lot is for example. That's a fantastic linking phrase, but don't use it too many times. Instead use to illustrate sometimes. It means the same thing, but makes the words different. It's perfect for writing when you want to give more than one example to support your claim. Let's try it in a pair of sentences. Here's for example. I love to read books.

Try changing that with a great paraphrase. Presume. That means you think something is true, but aren't positive. Both these words are like I guess. Check it out in a sentence. First, I think most people from my country travel a lot. Here's the new sentence. I presume most people from my country travel a lot. Using presume makes you stand out from the crowd and will help you improve your band score. Let's talk about think about.\"),\n",

Let's talk about think about. You need to pay attention because think can be used different ways. If you say think about, it means you are using your mind to look at a subject. Here's a good example. I'm thinking about moving to Australia. This is different than guess because you are now looking at different options before making a decision. Well, you can substitute consider for think about. Here's the sentence now. I'm considering moving to Australia. Consider using this word on your IELTS writing test. The next word is very common and you may use it a lot. I am talking about maybe. There is a good paraphrase for maybe so you can vary your vocabulary and that word is possibly. Check out this sentence. Maybe the government will create a new policy. It works the same way with possibly. Possibly the government will create a new policy. Now comes a word that many people use frequently. People. Since you talk about\"),\n",

Now comes a word that many people use frequently. People. Since you talk about hometowns a lot in the IELTS speaking section, you probably will talk about people in your hometown. People is a fine word, but if you want to include more words, try individuals. That refers to each one of the people together. Let's see how it works in a sentence. Many people in my town ride bicycles. That changes to many individuals in my town ride bicycles. This is an awesome word for IELTS writing too, since you may get a graph showing numbers of people or a discussion question involving your opinion related to people's actions and decisions. Here you can really show off your vocabulary by using individuals. While I'm talking about people, here's a specific group of people. Your family.

If you want something else, tell me your video wish in the comments, so I know what you would like to see on this channel. Now let's take a look at 25 more synonyms that help you get a band 9 on the aisles. One more word about your household. That word is live. It's really common when you are talking about the places where you grew up or have a house now. Try changing it with reside. That is usually used when talking about a place where you live. For example, you could say I live in a small apartment, but you can also show off your vocabulary by saying I reside in a small apartment. Here's another great paraphrase for discussing where you live in IELTS speaking. You can also use this word in the writing\"),\n",

You can also use this word in the writing section. Lots of people live in towns, so you say town a lot. Well, you can change that using community. That can refer to a smaller part of a town, but it also is a nice way of making your entire town sound like a friendly place. So here's a sentence. I live in a small town in the north of Maryland. The paraphrase is I live in a small community in the north of Maryland. Doesn't that sound like a friendly place to live? Of course, some people live in cities rather than towns. You might also want to talk about cities if you have an IELTS writing topic related to transportation or the environment. So paraphrase city with metropolis, a word that means really big city. For example, the environment next to a city can become very polluted. Show off your vocabulary by saying the environment next to a metropolis can become very polluted.

You can find the link below. Now, I want to talk a bit about hobbies. Clearly, you can talk about your hobbies by saying hobby, but a more advanced word is pastime. That is something you do in your spare time. In other words, it's a hobby. So you can change a sentence very easily, like my favorite hobby is reading books. That becomes my favorite pastime is reading books. I said try a lot in this video, and it's a useful word when talking about your pastimes. For example, you can say I want to try skiing.

I can change that by switching sound to appear. Both words mean seen, but appear is more formal. How does the sentence appear with the change? It appears like you really want challenge. Another common topic for IELTS speaking is food. Do you want a nice word that means food? Why not use cuisine? For example, food in my country uses a lot of chili peppers. Now the fancy version. Cuisine in my country uses a lot of chili peppers. It's good to give examples to support your claims in both IELTS writing and speaking.

So it's perfect to describe things that aren't famous throughout the world, but are notable in your area. I've said perfect a few times, haven't I? It's now time to give a paraphrase for that word. Perfect can be replaced with ideal. For example, that is a perfect way to boost your score becomes that is an ideal way to boost your score. Another common little word is very. You also might use really frequently. If you do, you might get nervous and repeat them again and again during IELTS speaking. You don't have to though.

Paraphrasing is an extremely good way to boost your score. If you're writing, you need to change a to an in that sentence. Be careful when replacing words in IELTS writing. Next, I want to talk about the word about. It's used in two main ways and I have paraphrases for both of them. The first is when you are talking about something that is not exact but close. Like I studied French for about six years. Really, it was five years and eight months but that's close enough, right? This usage is extremely common when reporting information about graphs in IELTS writing. You might say the percentage of sales increased to about 45 in 1998. An absolutely wonderful paraphrase is approximately. Listen to the sentence now. The percentage of sales increased to approximately 45 in 1998.\"),\n",

The other use of about that you see often is when you are discussing a particular topic and you want to refer to that topic. What I mean is you use about in a sentence like this. I have a question about lecture. Substitute about with regarding for a formal sentence. I have a question regarding the lecture. This is very advanced English and demonstrates that you have a wide vocabulary. Another common little word is mostly. Like people in my country mostly speak Spanish. Change the word to predominantly for a totally different sound. People in my country predominantly speak Spanish. Do you see how changing just one word makes a big difference in the impression you make? Here you can see that improving your IELTS score is not that hard.

For example the percentage of workers in the technology fields changed over time. That becomes the percentage of workers in the technology fields altered over time. One kind of change is when numbers go up. Saying go up is more precise than change. But you can show off your vocabulary with increase. For example the price of gasoline went up last year becomes the price of gasoline increased last year. Note that the opposite of increase is a decrease. That means go down. So if your sentence is the value of the dollar went down, you can instead say the value of the dollar decreased. This pair of words increase and decrease are really\"),\n",

Don't forget to use this word in both writing tasks as it showcases your ability to describe ways a trend changes. Another awesome graph word is a synonym for the highest point on a graph. That point is called the apex. Have a look at this sentence. The population rose after 1980 to the highest point of 10,000 people in 2000, then decreased from there. But wait that sentence can be even better. The population rose after 1980 to the apex of 10,000 people in 2000, then decreased from there. Well not all graphs show big upward or downward changes.

The first word that is used very often is say. I say it a lot and most other test takers do too. It\\'s a great word. If you use it too much though, your vocabulary sounds limited. There is lots of words to substitute for say. One that you can almost always paraphrase with is claim. Let\\'s look at the sentence. The economist said that prices would rise. Here\\'s claim. The economist claimed that prices would rise. Another common word for reporting what someone said is talk about. It\\'s used for a general subject, not a specific idea. Let\\'s compare this with said first, so you use it correctly. The professor said I should go to law school. The professor talked about going to law school. Here you can see that going to law school is a general idea, since it could be about anyone. But\\n\\nMany IELTS students use the same words over and over again. And this is a problem because one of the things the IELTS examiners are looking for is a broad vocabulary. If you demonstrate that you have a wide range of vocabulary, your band score will go up. It\\'s actually really easy to show off your vocabulary if you know synonyms, that is alternatives for commonly used words. And this is what you will learn in this video. I\\'m going to teach you 40 synonyms you must know to score high. By the end of this video, you will be equipped with a broad vocabulary that you can use in your IELTS test.

The video teaches 40 synonyms to help improve vocabulary and score high on the IELTS exam. Synonyms include claim for say, discuss for talk about, advocate for recommend, clarify for explain about, offer for give, inquire for ask, presume for think, consider for think about, possibly for maybe, individuals for people, household for family, reside for live, community for town, metropolis for city, pastime for hobby, attempt for try, appear for sound, cuisine for food, prominent for famous, ideal for perfect, extremely for very, approximately for about, regarding for about, predominantly for mostly, alter for change, increase for go up, decrease for go down, escalate for speed up, apex for highest point, extended period for long time, significant for large, minor for small, afterwards for then, however for but, nonetheless for however, frequently for a lot.\\n\\nSources:\\nMany IELTS students use the same words over and over again. And this is a problem because one of the things the IELTS examiners are looking for is a broad vocabulary. If you demonstrate that you have a wide range of vocabulary, your band score will go up. It's actually really easy to show off your vocabulary if you know synonyms, that is alternatives for commonly used words. And this is what you will learn in this video. I'm going to teach you 40 synonyms you must know to score high. By the end of this video, you will be equipped with a broad vocabulary that you can use in your IELTS test. If you're going to take your IELTS soon, check out my IELTS materials. There, I teach you everything you need to score high. I show you step by step how to give high scoring answers. And of course, we do many practice tests together, so you will feel confident for your test. You can find the link to the IELTS materials in the description box. And now, get a paper and a pen. For each synonym you know, you get one point. Comment below how many synonyms you know. For example, 20, 35 or 40. Let's get started. The first word that is used very often is say. I say it a lot and most other test takers do too. It's a great word. If you use it too much though, your vocabulary sounds limited. There is lots of words to substitute for say. One that you can almost always paraphrase with is claim. Let's look at the sentence. The economist said that prices would rise. Here's claim. The economist claimed that prices would rise. Another common word for reporting what someone said is talk about. It's used for a general subject, not a specific idea. Let's compare this with said first, so you use it correctly. The professor said I should go to law school. The professor talked about going to law school. Here you can see that going to law school is a general idea, since it could be about anyone. But said is specific instructions to me. So talk about can be replaced with discuss. The professor discussed going to law school. It sounds a little more formal and demonstrates that you have a broad range of vocabulary, which improves your band score. Let's again have a look at this example. The professor is recommending something, right? She's making a suggestion. You can change recommend to advocate. Note that advocate is followed by a noun or an idea starting with an ing verb like this. The teacher recommends studying. This changes to the teacher advocates studying. This word is very advanced. If you use it correctly, it will boost your score like this. While I'm talking about ways to say something, I should mention explain about. Let's look at the sentence. My mother explained about our family's history. You can replace explain about with clarified. My mother clarified our family's history. That means that the noun that is explained is very clear and easy to understand now. It's an awesome word that makes you sound smart. Often it has a person who now understands the topic too. That person is added with for. My mother clarified our family's history for me. You may end up using give a lot too. Like my sister gave me her bike when I moved into my own apartment. Give works well. If you want a polite word, you can also say offer. My sister offered me her bike when I moved into my own apartment. There is a slight difference. Give means you took the bike, but offer does not. It's implied that you did, unless you add more details. For example, my sister offered me her bike, but I already had one. That means she tried to give you the bike, but you said no. Offer is a polite way to say give and is a great word for paraphrasing to reduce repetition. The next word that is commonly used is ask. It's another word that has a great paraphrase. Inquire. It's really easy to replace one word with the other. For example, tourists often ask about famous places in my town. This changes to tourists often inquire about famous places in my town. What an easy way to show off your vocabulary. Speaking of easy, this word can be paraphrased too. What word should you use? Simple is the same as easy. You can change what an easy way to show off your vocabulary to what a simple way to show off your vocabulary. I want to mention one other thing about IELTS writing though. If you go back and change a word, be sure that you change the words around it too. Note that an easy way doesn't become a simple way. You have to change the n to a. So be careful. That was a good tip, wasn't it? Look at this sentence. My tip is to pay attention to all the words. There is a fancy word for tip too. Try recommendation. Here's the same sentence. My recommendation is to pay attention to all the words. Recommendation works the same way as tip, but it's much longer and sounds more formal. Learn to spell it correctly if you want to use it, since some IELTS students forget the double m. If you make spelling mistakes, your band score goes down. That's why it's super important to pay attention to spelling. One more phrase we use a lot is for example. That's a fantastic linking phrase, but don't use it too many times. Instead use to illustrate sometimes. It means the same thing, but makes the words different. It's perfect for writing when you want to give more than one example to support your claim. Let's try it in a pair of sentences. Here's for example. I love to read books. For example, I just finished a French novel. Here's the new sentences. I love to read books. To illustrate, I just finished a French novel. Now let's have a look at extra. Check out this sentence. Do you have an extra example to support your view? A longer way to say extra is additional. Try this sentence again with the new word. Do you have an additional example to support your view? This word is easy to remember because add means to put more on and additional is what that is put on. On the aisles you give a lot of opinions. Many IELTS students say I think a lot of times. Try changing that with a great paraphrase. Presume. That means you think something is true, but aren't positive. Both these words are like I guess. Check it out in a sentence. First, I think most people from my country travel a lot. Here's the new sentence. I presume most people from my country travel a lot. Using presume makes you stand out from the crowd and will help you improve your band score. Let's talk about think about. You need to pay attention because think can be used different ways. If you say think about, it means you are using your mind to look at a subject. Here's a good example. I'm thinking about moving to Australia. This is different than guess because you are now looking at different options before making a decision. Well, you can substitute consider for think about. Here's the sentence now. I'm considering moving to Australia. Consider using this word on your IELTS writing test. The next word is very common and you may use it a lot. I am talking about maybe. There is a good paraphrase for maybe so you can vary your vocabulary and that word is possibly. Check out this sentence. Maybe the government will create a new policy. It works the same way with possibly. Possibly the government will create a new policy. Now comes a word that many people use frequently. People. Since you talk about hometowns a lot in the IELTS speaking section, you probably will talk about people in your hometown. People is a fine word, but if you want to include more words, try individuals. That refers to each one of the people together. Let's see how it works in a sentence. Many people in my town ride bicycles. That changes to many individuals in my town ride bicycles. This is an awesome word for IELTS writing too, since you may get a graph showing numbers of people or a discussion question involving your opinion related to people's actions and decisions. Here you can really show off your vocabulary by using individuals. While I'm talking about people, here's a specific group of people. Your family. The IELTS speaking examiner might ask about who you live with or your family when you were growing up. Household refers to everyone who lives in the same house, so it usually refers to a family. Some people include their pets in their families and households too. For instance, my family includes my parents, brother and grandmother. That becomes my household includes my parents, brother and grandmother. Household is a bit more precise, so it's a great way to boost your score when you use it correctly. By the way, if you want more vocabulary videos, hit the like button and write yes in the comments. If you want something else, tell me your video wish in the comments so I know what you would like to see on this channel. Now let's take a look at 25 more synonyms that help you get a band 9 on the IELTS. One more word about your household. That word is live. It's really common when you're talking about the places where you grew up or have a house now. Try changing it with reside. That is usually used when talking about a place where you live. For example, you could say I live in a small apartment. But you can also show off your vocabulary by saying I reside in a small apartment. Here's another great paraphrase for discussing where you live in IELTS speaking. You can also use this word in the writing section. Lots of people live in towns, so you say town a lot. Well, you can change that using community. That can refer to a smaller part of a town, but it also is a nice way of making your entire town sound like a friendly place. So here's a sentence. I live in a small town in the north of Maryland. The paraphrase is I live in a small community in the north of Maryland. Doesn't that sound like a friendly place to live? Of course, some people live in cities rather than towns. You might also want to talk about cities if you have an IELTS writing topic related to transportation or the environment. So paraphrase city with metropolis, a word that means really big city. For example, the environment next to a city can become very polluted. Show off your vocabulary by saying the environment next to a metropolis can become very polluted. Please note that some people try to make metropolis plural in weird ways, like adding the letter I. Don't do it. The plural is just metropolises. If you want more vocabulary for speaking about hometowns, be sure to check out my video on that. In this video, you will learn 44 advanced words for talking about your hometown in IELTS speaking. You can find the link below. Now, I want to talk a bit about hobbies. Clearly, you can talk about your hobbies by saying hobby, but a more advanced word is pastime. That is something you do in your spare time. In other words, it's a hobby. So you can change a sentence very easily like my favorite hobby is reading books. That becomes my favorite pastime is reading books. I said try a lot in this video and it's a useful word when talking about your pastimes. For example, you can say I want to try skiing. Well, there is a perfect paraphrase for try too. It's attempt. Attempt includes the sound of a bit of effort, like you may or may not succeed. However, you want to do it. Here's the sentence with the new word. I want to attempt skiing. That makes it sound like you really want a challenge. It's a good image to share. You may have noticed I said sound a lot too. For example, it sounds like you really want a challenge. I can change that by switching sound to appear. Both words mean seen, but appear is more formal. How does the sentence appear with the change? It appears like you really want challenge. Another common topic for IELTS speaking is food. Do you want a nice word that means food? Why not use cuisine? For example, food in my country uses a lot of chili peppers. Now the fancy version. Cuisine in my country uses a lot of chili peppers. It's good to give examples to support your claims in both IELTS writing and speaking. One way to do that is mention something famous that fits the topic. Boost your vocabulary by changing famous to prominent. For example, you might say one famous landmark is a statue of Isaac Newton. Or you can change it to one prominent landmark is a statue of Isaac Newton. Prominent refers to something that is important or notable. So it's perfect to describe things that aren't famous throughout the world, but are notable in your area. I've said perfect a few times, haven't I? It's now time to give a paraphrase for that word. Perfect can be replaced with ideal. For example, that is a perfect way to boost your score becomes that is an ideal way to boost your score. Another common little word is very. You also might use really frequently. If you do, you might get nervous and repeat them again and again during IELTS speaking. You don't have to, though. Replace both of them with the awesome word extremely. Here's a sentence. Paraphrasing is a very good way to boost your score. Or paraphrasing is a really good way to boost your score. Now look at how both of those can be replaced. Paraphrasing is an extremely good way to boost your score. If you're writing, you need to change a to an in that sentence. Be careful when replacing words in IELTS writing. Next, I want to talk about the word about. It's used in two main ways and I have paraphrases for both of them. The first is when you are talking about something that is not exact, but close. Like, I studied French for about six years. Really, it was five years and eight months, but that's close enough, right? This usage is extremely common when reporting information about graphs in IELTS writing. You might say, the percentage of sales increased to about 45 in 1998. An absolutely wonderful paraphrase is approximately. Listen to the sentence now. The percentage of sales increased to approximately 45 in 1998. Definitely try using this paraphrase. It's extremely advanced and will help you improve your band score. The other use of about that you see often is when you are discussing a particular topic and you want to refer to that topic. What I mean is, you use about in a sentence like this. I have a question about lecture. Substitute about with regarding for a formal sentence. I have a question regarding the lecture. This is very advanced English and demonstrates that you have a wide vocabulary. Another common little word is mostly. Like, people in my country mostly speak Spanish. Change the word to predominantly for a totally different sound. People in my country predominantly speak Spanish. Do you see how changing just one word makes a big difference in the impression you make? Here you can see that improving your IELTS score is not that hard. You just need to know what you need to do to score high. Another common word for the IELTS is change. That's because you have to describe changes you see in graphs in the writing section. Plus, many of the writing discussion questions ask your opinion about changes. So replace change with alter some of the times you use it. For example, the percentage of workers in the technology fields changed over time. That becomes the percentage of workers in the technology fields altered over time. One kind of change is when numbers go up. Saying go up is more precise than change. But you can show off your vocabulary with increase. For example, the price of gasoline went up last year becomes the price of gasoline increased last year. Note that the opposite of increase is a decrease. That means go down. So if your sentence is the value of the dollar went down, you can instead say the value of the dollar decreased. This pair of words increase and decrease are really useful for describing data. While I'm talking about graphs, here's another great synonym. When a trend speeds up, you can say escalates. For example, deforestation in the Amazon has sped up over the past 15 years. Or you can say deforestation in the Amazon has escalated over the past 15 years. Don't forget to use this word in both writing tasks as it showcases your ability to describe ways a trend changes. Another awesome graph word is a synonym for the highest point on a graph. That point is called the apex. Have a look at this sentence. The population rose after 1980 to the highest point of 10,000 people in 2000, then decreased from there. But wait, that sentence can be even better. The population rose after 1980 to the apex of 10,000 people in 2000, then decreased from there. Well, not all graphs show big upward or downward changes. For a long time, the trend might be the same. That's okay, because there's a great synonym for long time. That phrase is\\nextended period. For example you might say for a long time the population remains stable. Try that with the new phrase. For an extended period the population remains stable. IELTS writing is so much easier with synonyms like this. Next is the word large. Large has lots of uses like saying that something is big or saying that something is important. As a result it gets overused. Significant means about the same thing. It shows that something is important or notable. Here's a good IELTS writing sentence for talking about a graph. There is a large difference in profits between 2010 and 2014. Try that with your new word significant. There is a significant difference in profits between 2010 and 2014. Doesn't that change your good sentence to an awesome one? Now if your change is not large you can still use a synonym. A word for small is minor. For example you can alter there was a small decrease in the polar bear population in 2020. The new version is there was a minor decrease in the polar bear population in 2020. That's a minor change to the sentence but it shows off your vocabulary. The next word is a linking word since those are also really useful. Then means that something comes later in time, right? But it's often used too much. Therefore think about using afterwards to illustrate. I grew up in Costa Rica then I moved to Brazil. The same idea is here. I grew up in Costa Rica afterwards I moved to Brazil. You can remember afterwards because it comes after the first idea. Another essential linking word is but. It's used a lot because it's a great way to show contrast between ideas. When you say too often change it with however. This one is a bit tricky because it changes one sentence to two. Here's what I mean. I like hiking but I only have time to hike on weekends. Here you can see that that is one sentence. However makes it two sentences. I like hiking however I only have time to hike on weekends. The meaning is the same but the structure is slightly different. This isn't a concern when you are talking but be careful in IELTS writing. If you like however you will love nonetheless. These can be changed without altering the sentence structure. Both show a contrast. Look at the previous example. I like hiking however I only have time to hike on weekends. That becomes I like hiking nonetheless I only have time to hike on weekends. Isn't that an awesome paraphrase? Finally I want to end with a lot. That's so common and I use it a lot right? So boost your vocabulary with frequently. It means often. Check out this sentence. I practice English a lot. Here's the new one. I practice English frequently. If you use them correctly these words really can show off your vocabulary and improve your IELTS score. That's it. That's 40 synonyms you must know to score high on the IELTS.

For each synonym you know, you get one point. Comment below how many synonyms you know. For example, 20, 35 or 40. Let\\'s get started. The first word that is used very often is say. I say it a lot and most other test takers do too. It\\'s a great word. If you use it too much though, your vocabulary sounds limited. There is lots of words to substitute for say. One that you can almost always paraphrase with is claim. Let\\'s look at the sentence. The economist said that prices would rise. Here\\'s claim. The economist claimed that prices would rise. Another common word for reporting what someone said is talk about. It\\'s used for a general subject, not a specific idea. Let\\'s compare this with said first, so you use it correctly. The professor said I should go to law school. The professor talked about going to law school. Here you can see that going to law school is a general idea, since it could be about anyone. But said is specific instructions to me. So talk about can be replaced with discuss. The professor discussed going to law school. It sounds a little more formal and demonstrates that you have a broad range of vocabulary, which improves your band score. Let\\'s again have a look at this example. The professor is recommending something, right? She\\'s making a suggestion. You can change recommend to advocate. Note that advocate is followed by a noun or an idea starting with an ing verb like this. The teacher recommends studying. This changes to the teacher advocates studying. This word is very advanced. If you use it correctly, it will boost your score like this. While I\\'m talking about ways to say something, I should mention explain about. Let\\'s look at the sentence. My mother explained about our family\\'s history. You can replace explain about with clarified. My mother clarified our family\\'s history. That means that the noun that is explained is very clear and easy to understand now. It\\'s an awesome word that makes you sound smart. Often it has a person who now understands the topic too. That person is added with for. My mother clarified our family\\'s history for me. You may end up using give a lot too. Like my sister gave me her bike when I moved into my own apartment. Give works well. If you want a polite word, you can also say offer. My sister offered me her bike when I moved into my own apartment. There is a slight difference. Give means you took the bike, but offer does not. It\\'s implied that you did, unless you add more details. For example, my sister offered me her bike, but I already had one. That means she tried to give you the bike, but you said no. Offer is a polite way to say give and is a great word for paraphrasing to reduce repetition. The next word that is commonly used is ask. It\\'s another word that has a great paraphrase. Inquire. It\\'s really easy to replace one word with the other. For example, tourists often ask about famous places in my town. This changes to tourists often inquire about famous places in my town. What an easy way to show off your vocabulary. Speaking of easy, this word can be paraphrased too. What word should you use? Simple is the same as easy. You can change what an easy way to show off your vocabulary to what a simple way to show off your vocabulary. I want to mention one other thing about IELTS writing though. If you go back and change a word, be sure that you change the words around it too. Note that an easy way doesn\\'t become a simple way. You have to change the n to a. So be careful. That was a good tip, wasn\\'t it? Look at this sentence. My tip is to pay attention to all the words. There is a fancy word for tip too. Try recommendation. Here\\'s the same sentence. My recommendation is to pay attention to all the words. Recommendation works the same way as tip, but it\\'s much longer and sounds more formal. Learn to spell it correctly if you want to use it, since some IELTS students forget the double m. If you make spelling mistakes, your band score goes down. That\\'s why it\\'s super important to pay attention to spelling. One more phrase we use a lot is for example. That\\'s a fantastic linking phrase, but don\\'t use it too many times. Instead use to illustrate sometimes. It means the same thing, but makes the words different. It\\'s perfect for writing when you want to give more than one example to support your claim. Let\\'s try it in a pair of sentences. Here\\'s for example. I love to read books. For example, I just finished a French novel. Here\\'s the new sentences. I love to read books. To illustrate, I just finished a French novel. Now let\\'s have a look at extra. Check out this sentence. Do you have an extra example to support your view? A longer way to say extra is additional. Try this sentence again with the new word. Do you have an additional example to support your view? This word is easy to remember because add means to put more on and additional is what that is put on. On the aisles you give a lot of opinions. Many IELTS students say I think a lot of times. Try changing that with a great paraphrase. Presume. That means you think something is true, but aren\\'t positive. Both these words are like I guess. Check it out in a sentence. First, I think most people from my country travel a lot. Here\\'s the new sentence. I presume most people from my country travel a lot. Using presume makes you stand out from the crowd and will help you improve your band score. Let\\'s talk about think about. You need to pay attention because think can be used different ways. If you say think about, it means you are using your mind to look at a subject. Here\\'s a good example. I\\'m thinking about moving to Australia. This is different than guess because you are now looking at different options before making a decision. Well, you can substitute consider for think about. Here\\'s the sentence now. I\\'m considering moving to Australia. Consider using this word on your IELTS writing test. The next word is very common and you may use it a lot. I am talking about maybe. There is a good paraphrase for maybe so you can vary your vocabulary and that word is possibly. Check out this sentence. Maybe the government will create a new policy. It works the same way with possibly. Possibly the government will create a new policy. Now comes a word that many people use frequently. People. Since you talk about hometowns a lot in the IELTS speaking section, you probably will talk about people in your hometown. People is a fine word, but if you want to include more words, try individuals. That refers to each one of the people together. Let\\'s see how it works in a sentence. Many people in my town ride bicycles. That changes to many individuals in my town ride bicycles. This is an awesome word for IELTS writing too, since you may get a graph showing numbers of people or a discussion question involving your opinion related to people\\'s actions and decisions. Here you can really show off your vocabulary by using individuals. While I\\'m talking about people, here\\'s a specific group of people. Your family. The IELTS speaking examiner might ask about who you live with or your family when you were growing up. Household refers to everyone who lives in the same house, so it usually refers to a family. Some people include their pets in their families and households too. For instance, my family includes my parents, brother and grandmother. That becomes my household includes my parents, brother and grandmother. Household is a bit more precise, so it\\'s a great way to boost your score when you use it correctly. By the way, if you want more vocabulary videos, hit the like button and write yes in the comments. If you want something else, tell me your video wish in the comments so I know what you would like to see on this channel. Now let\\'s take a look at 25 more synonyms that help you get a band 9 on the IELTS. One more word about your household. That word is live. It\\'s really common when you\\'re talking about the places where you grew up or have a house now. Try changing it with reside. That is usually used when talking about a place where you live. For example, you could say I live in a small apartment. But you can also show off your vocabulary by saying I reside in a small apartment. Here\\'s another great paraphrase for discussing where you live in IELTS speaking. You can also use this word in the writing section. Lots of people live in towns, so you say town a lot. Well, you can change that using community. That can refer to a smaller part of a town, but it also is a nice way of making your entire town sound like a friendly place. So here\\'s a sentence. I live in a small town in the north of Maryland. The paraphrase is I live in a small community in the north of Maryland. Doesn\\'t that sound like a friendly place to live? Of course, some people live in cities rather than towns. You might also want to talk about cities if you have an IELTS writing topic related to transportation or the environment. So paraphrase city with metropolis, a word that means really big city. For example, the environment next to a city can become very polluted. Show off your vocabulary by saying the environment next to a metropolis can become very polluted. Please note that some people try to make metropolis plural in weird ways, like adding the letter I. Don\\'t do it. The plural is just metropolises. If you want more vocabulary for speaking about hometowns, be sure to check out my video on that. In this video, you will learn 44 advanced words for talking about your hometown in IELTS speaking. You can find the link below. Now, I want to talk a bit about hobbies. Clearly, you can talk about your hobbies by saying hobby, but a more advanced word is pastime. That is something you do in your spare time. In other words, it\\'s a hobby. So you can change a sentence very easily like my favorite hobby is reading books. That becomes my favorite pastime is reading books. I said try a lot in this video and it\\'s a useful word when talking about your pastimes. For example, you can say I want to try skiing. Well, there is a perfect paraphrase for try too. It\\'s attempt. Attempt includes the sound of a bit of effort, like you may or may not succeed. However, you want to do it. Here\\'s the sentence with the new word. I want to attempt skiing. That makes it sound like you really want a challenge. It\\'s a good image to share. You may have noticed I said sound a lot too. For example, it sounds like you really want a challenge. I can change that by switching sound to appear. Both words mean seen, but appear is more formal. How does the sentence appear with the change? It appears like you really want challenge. Another common topic for IELTS speaking is food. Do you want a nice word that means food? Why not use cuisine? For example, food in my country uses a lot of chili peppers. Now the fancy version. Cuisine in my country uses a lot of chili peppers. It\\'s good to give examples to support your claims in both IELTS writing and speaking. One way to do that is mention something famous that fits the topic. Boost your vocabulary by changing famous to prominent. For example, you might say one famous landmark is a statue of Isaac Newton. Or you can change it to one prominent landmark is a statue of Isaac Newton. Prominent refers to something that is important or notable. So it\\'s perfect to describe things that aren\\'t famous throughout the world, but are notable in your area. I\\'ve said perfect a few times, haven\\'t I? It\\'s now time to give a paraphrase for that word. Perfect can be replaced with ideal. For example, that is a perfect way to boost your score becomes that is an ideal way to boost your score. Another common little word is very. You also might use really frequently. If you do, you might get nervous and repeat them again and again during IELTS speaking. You don\\'t have to, though. Replace both of them with the awesome word extremely. Here\\'s a sentence. Paraphrasing is a very good way to boost your score. Or paraphrasing is a really good way to boost your score. Now look at how both of those can be replaced. Paraphrasing is an extremely good way to boost your score. If you\\'re writing, you need to change a to an in that sentence. Be careful when replacing words in IELTS writing. Next, I want to talk about the word about. It\\'s used in two main ways and I have paraphrases for both of them. The first is when you are talking about something that is not exact, but close. Like, I studied French for about six years. Really, it was five years and eight months, but that\\'s close enough, right? This usage is extremely common when reporting information about graphs in IELTS writing. You might say, the percentage of sales increased to about 45 in 1998. An absolutely wonderful paraphrase is approximately. Listen to the sentence now. The percentage of sales increased to approximately 45 in 1998. Definitely try using this paraphrase. It\\'s extremely advanced and will help you improve your band score. The other use of about that you see often is when you are discussing a particular topic and you want to refer to that topic. What I mean is, you use about in a sentence like this. I have a question about lecture. Substitute about with regarding for a formal sentence. I have a question regarding the lecture. This is very advanced English and demonstrates that you have a wide vocabulary. Another common little word is mostly. Like, people in my country mostly speak Spanish. Change the word to predominantly for a totally different sound. People in my country predominantly speak Spanish. Do you see how changing just one word makes a big difference in the impression you make? Here you can see that improving your IELTS score is not that hard. You just need to know what you need to do to score high. Another common word for the IELTS is change. That\\'s because you have to describe changes you see in graphs in the writing section. Plus, many of the writing discussion questions ask your opinion about changes. So replace change with alter some of the times you use it. For example, the percentage of workers in the technology fields changed over time. That becomes the percentage of workers in the technology fields altered over time. One kind of change is when numbers go up. Saying go up is more precise than change. But you can show off your vocabulary with increase. For example, the price of gasoline went up last year becomes the price of gasoline increased last year. Note that the opposite of increase is a decrease. That means go down. So if your sentence is the value of the dollar went down, you can instead say the value of the dollar decreased. This pair of words increase and decrease are really useful for describing data. While I\\'m talking about graphs, here\\'s another great synonym. When a trend speeds up, you can say escalates. For example, deforestation in the Amazon has sped up over the past 15 years. Or you can say deforestation in the Amazon has escalated over the past 15 years. Don\\'t forget to use this word in both writing tasks as it showcases your ability to describe ways a trend changes. Another awesome graph word is a synonym for the highest point on a graph. That point is called the apex. Have a look at this sentence. The population rose after 1980 to the highest point of 10,000 people in 2000, then decreased from there. But wait, that sentence can be even better. The population rose after 1980 to the apex of 10,000 people in 2000, then decreased from there. Well, not all graphs show big upward or downward changes. For a long time, the trend might be the same. That\\'s okay, because there\\'s a great synonym for long time. That phrase is\\nextended period. For example you might say for a long time the population remains stable. Try that with the new phrase. For an extended period the population remains stable. IELTS writing is so much easier with synonyms like this. Next is the word large. Large has lots of uses like saying that something is big or saying that something is important. As a result it gets overused. Significant means about the same thing. It shows that something is important or notable. Here\\'s a good IELTS writing sentence for talking about a graph. There is a large difference in profits between 2010 and 2014. Try that with your new word significant. There is a significant difference in profits between 2010 and 2014. Doesn\\'t that change your good sentence to an awesome one? Now if your change is not large you can still use a synonym. A word for small is minor. For example you can alter there was a small decrease in the polar bear population in 2020. The new version is there was a minor decrease in the polar bear population in 2020. That\\'s a minor change to the sentence but it shows off your vocabulary. The next word is a linking word since those are also really useful. Then means that something comes later in time, right? But it\\'s often used too much. Therefore think about using afterwards to illustrate. I grew up in Costa Rica then I moved to Brazil. The same idea is here. I grew up in Costa Rica afterwards I moved to Brazil. You can remember afterwards because it comes after the first idea. Another essential linking word is but. It\\'s used a lot because it\\'s a great way to show contrast between ideas. When you say too often change it with however. This one is a bit tricky because it changes one sentence to two. Here\\'s what I mean. I like hiking but I only have time to hike on weekends. Here you can see that that is one sentence. However makes it two sentences. I like hiking however I only have time to hike on weekends. The meaning is the same but the structure is slightly different. This isn\\'t a concern when you are talking but be careful in IELTS writing. If you like however you will love nonetheless. These can be changed without altering the sentence structure. Both show a contrast. Look at the previous example. I like hiking however I only have time to hike on weekends. That becomes I like hiking nonetheless I only have time to hike on weekends. Isn\\'t that an awesome paraphrase? Finally I want to end with a lot. That\\'s so common and I use it a lot right? So boost your vocabulary with frequently. It means often. Check out this sentence. I practice English a lot. Here\\'s the new one. I practice English frequently. If you use them correctly these words really can show off your vocabulary and improve your IELTS score. That\\'s it. That\\'s 40 synonyms you must know to score high on the IELTS.

And this is a problem because one of the things the IELTS examiners are looking for is a broad vocabulary. If you demonstrate that you have a wide range of vocabulary, your band score will go up. It\\'s actually really easy to show off your vocabulary if you know synonyms, that is alternatives for commonly used words. And this is what you will learn in this video. I\\'m going to teach you 40 synonyms you must know to score high. By the end of this video, you will be equipped with a broad vocabulary that you can use in your IELTS test. If you\\'re going to take your IELTS soon, check out my IELTS materials. There, I teach you everything you need to score high. I show you step by step how to give high scoring answers. And of course, we do many practice tests together, so you will feel confident for your test. You can find the link to the IELTS materials in the description box. And now, get a paper and a pen. For each synonym you know, you get one point. Comment below how many synonyms you know. For example, 20, 35 or 40. Let\\'s get started. The first word that is used very often is say. I say it a lot and most other test takers do too. It\\'s a great word. If you use it too much though, your vocabulary sounds limited. There is lots of words to substitute for say. One that you can almost always paraphrase with is claim. Let\\'s look at the sentence. The economist said that prices would rise. Here\\'s claim. The economist claimed that prices would rise. Another common word for reporting what someone said is talk about. It\\'s used for a general subject, not a specific idea. Let\\'s compare this with said first, so you use it correctly. The professor said I should go to law school. The professor talked about going to law school. Here you can see that going to law school is a general idea, since it could be about anyone. But said is specific instructions to me. So talk about can be replaced with discuss. The professor discussed going to law school. It sounds a little more formal and demonstrates that you have a broad range of vocabulary, which improves your band score. Let\\'s again have a look at this example. The professor is recommending something, right? She\\'s making a suggestion. You can change recommend to advocate. Note that advocate is followed by a noun or an idea starting with an ing verb like this. The teacher recommends studying. This changes to the teacher advocates studying. This word is very advanced. If you use it correctly, it will boost your score like this. While I\\'m talking about ways to say something, I should mention explain about. Let\\'s look at the sentence. My mother explained about our family\\'s history. You can replace explain about with clarified. My mother clarified our family\\'s history. That means that the noun that is explained is very clear and easy to understand now. It\\'s an awesome word that makes you sound smart. Often it has a person who now understands the topic too. That person is added with for. My mother clarified our family\\'s history for me. You may end up using give a lot too. Like my sister gave me her bike when I moved into my own apartment. Give works well. If you want a polite word, you can also say offer. My sister offered me her bike when I moved into my own apartment. There is a slight difference. Give means you took the bike, but offer does not. It\\'s implied that you did, unless you add more details. For example, my sister offered me her bike, but I already had one. That means she tried to give you the bike, but you said no. Offer is a polite way to say give and is a great word for paraphrasing to reduce repetition. The next word that is commonly used is ask. It\\'s another word that has a great paraphrase. Inquire. It\\'s really easy to replace one word with the other. For example, tourists often ask about famous places in my town. This changes to tourists often inquire about famous places in my town. What an easy way to show off your vocabulary. Speaking of easy, this word can be paraphrased too. What word should you use? Simple is the same as easy. You can change what an easy way to show off your vocabulary to what a simple way to show off your vocabulary. I want to mention one other thing about IELTS writing though. If you go back and change a word, be sure that you change the words around it too. Note that an easy way doesn\\'t become a simple way. You have to change the n to a. So be careful. That was a good tip, wasn\\'t it? Look at this sentence. My tip is to pay attention to all the words. There is a fancy word for tip too. Try recommendation. Here\\'s the same sentence. My recommendation is to pay attention to all the words. Recommendation works the same way as tip, but it\\'s much longer and sounds more formal. Learn to spell it correctly if you want to use it, since some IELTS students forget the double m. If you make spelling mistakes, your band score goes down. That\\'s why it\\'s super important to pay attention to spelling. One more phrase we use a lot is for example. That\\'s a fantastic linking phrase, but don\\'t use it too many times. Instead use to illustrate sometimes. It means the same thing, but makes the words different. It\\'s perfect for writing when you want to give more than one example to support your claim. Let\\'s try it in a pair of sentences. Here\\'s for example. I love to read books. For example, I just finished a French novel. Here\\'s the new sentences. I love to read books. To illustrate, I just finished a French novel. Now let\\'s have a look at extra. Check out this sentence. Do you have an extra example to support your view? A longer way to say extra is additional. Try this sentence again with the new word. Do you have an additional example to support your view? This word is easy to remember because add means to put more on and additional is what that is put on. On the aisles you give a lot of opinions. Many IELTS students say I think a lot of times. Try changing that with a great paraphrase. Presume. That means you think something is true, but aren\\'t positive. Both these words are like I guess. Check it out in a sentence. First, I think most people from my country travel a lot. Here\\'s the new sentence. I presume most people from my country travel a lot. Using presume makes you stand out from the crowd and will help you improve your band score. Let\\'s talk about think about. You need to pay attention because think can be used different ways. If you say think about, it means you are using your mind to look at a subject. Here\\'s a good example. I\\'m thinking about moving to Australia. This is different than guess because you are now looking at different options before making a decision. Well, you can substitute consider for think about. Here\\'s the sentence now. I\\'m considering moving to Australia. Consider using this word on your IELTS writing test. The next word is very common and you may use it a lot. I am talking about maybe. There is a good paraphrase for maybe so you can vary your vocabulary and that word is possibly. Check out this sentence. Maybe the government will create a new policy. It works the same way with possibly. Possibly the government will create a new policy. Now comes a word that many people use frequently. People. Since you talk about hometowns a lot in the IELTS speaking section, you probably will talk about people in your hometown. People is a fine word, but if you want to include more words, try individuals. That refers to each one of the people together. Let\\'s see how it works in a sentence. Many people in my town ride bicycles. That changes to many individuals in my town ride bicycles. This is an awesome word for IELTS writing too, since you may get a graph showing numbers of people or a discussion question involving your opinion related to people\\'s actions and decisions. Here you can really show off your vocabulary by using individuals. While I\\'m talking about people, here\\'s a specific group of people. Your family. The IELTS speaking examiner might ask about who you live with or your family when you were growing up. Household refers to everyone who lives in the same house, so it usually refers to a family. Some people include their pets in their families and households too. For instance, my family includes my parents, brother and grandmother. That becomes my household includes my parents, brother and grandmother. Household is a bit more precise, so it\\'s a great way to boost your score when you use it correctly. By the way, if you want more vocabulary videos, hit the like button and write yes in the comments. If you want something else, tell me your video wish in the comments so I know what you would like to see on this channel. Now let\\'s take a look at 25 more synonyms that help you get a band 9 on the IELTS. One more word about your household. That word is live. It\\'s really common when you\\'re talking about the places where you grew up or have a house now. Try changing it with reside. That is usually used when talking about a place where you live. For example, you could say I live in a small apartment. But you can also show off your vocabulary by saying I reside in a small apartment. Here\\'s another great paraphrase for discussing where you live in IELTS speaking. You can also use this word in the writing section. Lots of people live in towns, so you say town a lot. Well, you can change that using community. That can refer to a smaller part of a town, but it also is a nice way of making your entire town sound like a friendly place. So here\\'s a sentence. I live in a small town in the north of Maryland. The paraphrase is I live in a small community in the north of Maryland. Doesn\\'t that sound like a friendly place to live? Of course, some people live in cities rather than towns. You might also want to talk about cities if you have an IELTS writing topic related to transportation or the environment. So paraphrase city with metropolis, a word that means really big city. For example, the environment next to a city can become very polluted. Show off your vocabulary by saying the environment next to a metropolis can become very polluted. Please note that some people try to make metropolis plural in weird ways, like adding the letter I. Don\\'t do it. The plural is just metropolises. If you want more vocabulary for speaking about hometowns, be sure to check out my video on that. In this video, you will learn 44 advanced words for talking about your hometown in IELTS speaking. You can find the link below. Now, I want to talk a bit about hobbies. Clearly, you can talk about your hobbies by saying hobby, but a more advanced word is pastime. That is something you do in your spare time. In other words, it\\'s a hobby. So you can change a sentence very easily like my favorite hobby is reading books. That becomes my favorite pastime is reading books. I said try a lot in this video and it\\'s a useful word when talking about your pastimes. For example, you can say I want to try skiing. Well, there is a perfect paraphrase for try too. It\\'s attempt. Attempt includes the sound of a bit of effort, like you may or may not succeed. However, you want to do it. Here\\'s the sentence with the new word. I want to attempt skiing. That makes it sound like you really want a challenge. It\\'s a good image to share. You may have noticed I said sound a lot too. For example, it sounds like you really want a challenge. I can change that by switching sound to appear. Both words mean seen, but appear is more formal. How does the sentence appear with the change? It appears like you really want challenge. Another common topic for IELTS speaking is food. Do you want a nice word that means food? Why not use cuisine? For example, food in my country uses a lot of chili peppers. Now the fancy version. Cuisine in my country uses a lot of chili peppers. It\\'s good to give examples to support your claims in both IELTS writing and speaking. One way to do that is mention something famous that fits the topic. Boost your vocabulary by changing famous to prominent. For example, you might say one famous landmark is a statue of Isaac Newton. Or you can change it to one prominent landmark is a statue of Isaac Newton. Prominent refers to something that is important or notable. So it\\'s perfect to describe things that aren\\'t famous throughout the world, but are notable in your area. I\\'ve said perfect a few times, haven\\'t I? It\\'s now time to give a paraphrase for that word. Perfect can be replaced with ideal. For example, that is a perfect way to boost your score becomes that is an ideal way to boost your score. Another common little word is very. You also might use really frequently. If you do, you might get nervous and repeat them again and again during IELTS speaking. You don\\'t have to, though. Replace both of them with the awesome word extremely. Here\\'s a sentence. Paraphrasing is a very good way to boost your score. Or paraphrasing is a really good way to boost your score. Now look at how both of those can be replaced. Paraphrasing is an extremely good way to boost your score. If you\\'re writing, you need to change a to an in that sentence. Be careful when replacing words in IELTS writing. Next, I want to talk about the word about. It\\'s used in two main ways and I have paraphrases for both of them. The first is when you are talking about something that is not exact, but close. Like, I studied French for about six years. Really, it was five years and eight months, but that\\'s close enough, right? This usage is extremely common when reporting information about graphs in IELTS writing. You might say, the percentage of sales increased to about 45 in 1998. An absolutely wonderful paraphrase is approximately. Listen to the sentence now. The percentage of sales increased to approximately 45 in 1998. Definitely try using this paraphrase. It\\'s extremely advanced and will help you improve your band score. The other use of about that you see often is when you are discussing a particular topic and you want to refer to that topic. What I mean is, you use about in a sentence like this. I have a question about lecture. Substitute about with regarding for a formal sentence. I have a question regarding the lecture. This is very advanced English and demonstrates that you have a wide vocabulary. Another common little word is mostly. Like, people in my country mostly speak Spanish. Change the word to predominantly for a totally different sound. People in my country predominantly speak Spanish. Do you see how changing just one word makes a big difference in the impression you make? Here you can see that improving your IELTS score is not that hard. You just need to know what you need to do to score high. Another common word for the IELTS is change. That\\'s because you have to describe changes you see in graphs in the writing section. Plus, many of the writing discussion questions ask your opinion about changes. So replace change with alter some of the times you use it. For example, the percentage of workers in the technology fields changed over time. That becomes the percentage of workers in the technology fields altered over time. One kind of change is when numbers go up. Saying go up is more precise than change. But you can show off your vocabulary with increase. For example, the price of gasoline went up last year becomes the price of gasoline increased last year. Note that the opposite of increase is a decrease. That means go down. So if your sentence is the value of the dollar went down, you can instead say the value of the dollar decreased. This pair of words increase and decrease are really useful for describing data. While I\\'m talking about graphs, here\\'s another great synonym. When a trend speeds up, you can say escalates. For example, deforestation in the Amazon has sped up over the past 15 years. Or you can say deforestation in the Amazon has escalated over the past 15 years. Don\\'t forget to use this word in both writing tasks as it showcases your ability to describe ways a trend changes. Another awesome graph word is a synonym for the highest point on a graph. That point is called the apex. Have a look at this sentence. The population rose after 1980 to the highest point of 10,000 people in 2000, then decreased from there. But wait, that sentence can be even better. The population rose after 1980 to the apex of 10,000 people in 2000, then decreased from there. Well, not all graphs show big upward or downward changes. For a long time, the trend might be the same. That\\'s okay, because there\\'s a great synonym for long time. That phrase is\\nextended period. For example you might say for a long time the population remains stable. Try that with the new phrase. For an extended period the population remains stable. IELTS writing is so much easier with synonyms like this. Next is the word large. Large has lots of uses like saying that something is big or saying that something is important. As a result it gets overused. Significant means about the same thing. It shows that something is important or notable. Here\\'s a good IELTS writing sentence for talking about a graph. There is a large difference in profits between 2010 and 2014. Try that with your new word significant. There is a significant difference in profits between 2010 and 2014. Doesn\\'t that change your good sentence to an awesome one? Now if your change is not large you can still use a synonym. A word for small is minor. For example you can alter there was a small decrease in the polar bear population in 2020. The new version is there was a minor decrease in the polar bear population in 2020. That\\'s a minor change to the sentence but it shows off your vocabulary. The next word is a linking word since those are also really useful. Then means that something comes later in time, right? But it\\'s often used too much. Therefore think about using afterwards to illustrate. I grew up in Costa Rica then I moved to Brazil. The same idea is here. I grew up in Costa Rica afterwards I moved to Brazil. You can remember afterwards because it comes after the first idea. Another essential linking word is but. It\\'s used a lot because it\\'s a great way to show contrast between ideas. When you say too often change it with however. This one is a bit tricky because it changes one sentence to two. Here\\'s what I mean. I like hiking but I only have time to hike on weekends. Here you can see that that is one sentence. However makes it two sentences. I like hiking however I only have time to hike on weekends. The meaning is the same but the structure is slightly different. This isn\\'t a concern when you are talking but be careful in IELTS writing. If you like however you will love nonetheless. These can be changed without altering the sentence structure. Both show a contrast. Look at the previous example. I like hiking however I only have time to hike on weekends. That becomes I like hiking nonetheless I only have time to hike on weekends. Isn\\'t that an awesome paraphrase? Finally I want to end with a lot. That\\'s so common and I use it a lot right? So boost your vocabulary with frequently. It means often. Check out this sentence. I practice English a lot. Here\\'s the new one. I practice English frequently. If you use them correctly these words really can show off your vocabulary and improve your IELTS score. That\\'s it. That\\'s 40 synonyms you must know to score high on the IELTS.

So let's say that you find out that you really need help with your vocabulary. Then when you're listening to a podcast and you hear a new word, note that new word down. Guess what that word means from the context. Note down all the information you need to remember that word, such as meaning, synonyms, antonyms, collocations, sentences, pronunciation, all of these things.

Focus on one thing at a time, for example, vocabulary, accent, intonation, multiple speakers, and normally focus on the thing that you really need help with. So let's say that you find out that you really need help with your vocabulary. Then when you're listening to a podcast and you hear a new word, note that new word down. Guess what that word means from the context. Note down all the information you need to remember that word, such as meaning, synonyms, antonyms, collocations, sentences, pronunciation, all of these things. And then in a few weeks, a few months, you will have a vocabulary book just full of new words that you have learned.

It seems pretty obvious, but not many students think of it that way. I think maybe because it's studying and a lot of people think that studying should be boring and studying should be laborious. It doesn't have to be. And the great thing about all of these, so podcasts, TV, movies, radio, TED Talks, YouTube, real people. Apart from real people, all of these are in the palm of your hand.

Listen to a podcast where there are those accents and listen for words that you don't really understand. Listen again, listen again, until you figure out what that word is, or intonation. What you can do is, let's say you're watching a movie, look at the movie script, or look at the subtitles, and guess what the intonation is going to be like, and then compare it with how the actor says it, and then mimic what they say.
