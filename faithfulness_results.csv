Explanation: The answer is fully supported by the documents as it directly states that tips or tricks do not work and are the best way to prolong your IELTS journey and waste money. The documents emphasize the importance of consistent daily practice rather than relying on last-minute cramming or shortcuts"
How much English do most students actually listen to each week?,This information is not mentioned in the transcript of the video.,"a lot less than you think. But it's so easy these days to listen to English every day because we carry it with us on our phone. So you could watch TV, you could listen to the radio, you could listen to podcasts, you could watch YouTube, you could listen to TED Talks. And I'm sure that there are hundreds of other ways that you could listen to English. If you live in an English-speaking country, go out and speak to people and listen to how people talk. The key here is not which TV show will help you improve your IELTS score or which podcast will help you improve your IELTS score or which TEDI would tell you, but they don't. So number one, stop looking for tips and tricks. They do not work. Number two, listen to English every day. Now this sounds really, really obvious. This sounds like something that, you know, of course I'm going to do that. But very few students who I actually work with on a one-to-one basis, when they have a problem with listening, normally the first thing I say is, well, how many hours a day do you listen to English? Normally the answer comes back hours per day. I don't listen to even one hour per week. If you count up the number of minutes you spend eachday. I don't listen to even one hour per week. If you count up the number of minutes you spend each week listening, like I have lots of podcast apps on my phone and some of them are really cool. They can tell you how much you're listening. I think the new iPhones or the new update for iPhone tells you how much time you spend on each app. And there's a lot of apps that do tell you that. If you add up all the time you spend listening to podcasts or YouTube or, you know, watching TED Talks, it's a lot less than you think. But it's so easy these days to listen to English every day because weIELTS practice series, like that's a long time. For listening alone, that would be what, 40, 50 hours of your time. If you didn't think strategically about this and do some crucial things, then you've just wasted your time. And you wouldn't believe the number of students that I speak to that are really, really angry with the fact that they have spent all that time practicing and their scores aren't improving. And it really comes down to this, practicing strategically. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a whole lesson on how to practice strategically for listening on Wednesday, same",NO,"

The answer is not fully supported by the documents. The documents provided discuss the importance of listening to English every day and the ineffectiveness of looking for tips and tricks to improve IELTS scores. However, there is no mention of the specific information that the answer claims is not mentioned in the transcript of the video"
What is 'active listening' according to the video?,Active listening is when you focus on one thing at a time and do something while you're listening.,"improve your spelling, active listening would mean that when you're listening to something and you hear a word that you're unsure of the spelling, you would write it down and then you would check the spelling in a dictionary and you would keep doing that until it improved your listening. Active listening is when you focus on one thing at a time and do something while you're listening. Let's say you wanted to improve your vocabulary. What you would do is listen to a podcast or something like that or YouTube or TED Talk. When you hear a word you don't know, write that word down, write all theor YouTube or TED Talk. When you hear a word you don't know, write that word down, write all the information you need to remember that word and then review that word. Actively listening means you're doing something to help improve a specific area. That could be vocabulary, grammar, accent, pronunciation, all of these different things that you can focus on. One of those is spelling. As I just said, you could focus on your spelling and actively listen to improve your spelling. Spelling is really, really important for IELTS listening for a few different reasons. Number one, normally people messlistening to a range of topics, accents, and one person versus multiple people. Also, when you're listening, we just did this lesson on Facebook before we did it here. There's a great question came up from one of the girls who was listening. She said that, I listen to podcasts for two hours every single day and my spelling is still terrible. I said, okay, what you need to do is actively listen. What does actively listen mean? For example, if you were terrible at spelling and you really needed to improve your spelling, active listening would mean that when you're listening to something and youis I'm going to do a whole lesson on how to practice strategically for listening on Wednesday, same time Wednesday, join me here on YouTube and we'll go through that. I wanted to do a separate lesson because it's so important. And I really think a lot of you are going to benefit from that one on Wednesday. So let me see if there are any questions. First of all, stop talking and listen to Chris. He is giving us simple. Good, good advice. Yeah, cause it's really difficult for me to find questions when all of you are just having little conversations. Yeah, I can't find most of the answers",YES,"

Explanation: The retrieved documents clearly explain that active listening involves focusing on one thing at a time and doing something while listening, such as writing down unfamiliar words to improve vocabulary or spelling. This aligns with the statement that active listening is when you focus on one thing at a time and do something while you're listening"
Why must your spelling be 100% correct when transferring answers?,"If you get even one letter out of place, it is wrong. It doesn't matter if it's very close or it's just two letters the wrong way, it's going to be wrong.","or I'm distracted or I'm not focused. What you need to do is make sure that you are, when you're transferring your answers over in the last part of the test, when you have that time at the end to transfer your answers over, make sure your spelling is 100% spot on because if you get even one letter out of place, it is wrong. It doesn't matter if it's very close or it's just two letters the wrong way, it's going to be wrong. And also be very harsh when you're practicing. So when you are practicing, you're going to have to give yourself a score by checking your answers. Often when people checkbe before the recording starts. And that is really, really going to help you. Spelling, we've also covered. Grammar, there are certain types of questions where you're going to have to be aware of grammar. And if the grammar is not correct, you're going to get a wrong answer. Also being aware of grammar and thinking about grammar is going to help you predict the answer and get the correct answer ultimately. And also, as with the reading test, the most important thing is that you improve your vocabulary. For many of you, it doesn't matter how many strategies or tips you listen to. If youryou're going to have to give yourself a score by checking your answers. Often when people check those answers, if the spelling is a little off, they'll give themselves a mark. They will tick it and they will give themselves that correct answer. You need to be realistic. You need to know your real score before you do the test. I was working with one student a couple of weeks ago and they said to me, every time I do the test, I get like a seven or sorry, an eight or 8.5 when I'm practicing at home. But when I do the test, it's like seven, 7.5. So they were getting really high scores inat home. But when I do the test, it's like seven, 7.5. So they were getting really high scores in practice, lower scores on test day. I wasn't sure what this was and then I looked at their actual answers and multiple answers were spelled incorrectly, but they were giving themselves the correct answer. They're like, ah, it's just a little bit off. That doesn't matter. On the test, they're going to give you a incorrect answer for that. So be harsh and record your mistakes. Get yourself a notebook, just a plain notebook. Could be any sort of notebook you want and it doesn't matter how expensive",YES,"

Explanation: The answer is fully supported by the documents as it clearly states that even if one letter is out of place, the answer is considered wrong. It emphasizes the importance of accurate spelling in order to get the correct answer"
What is the purpose of keeping a notebook during practice?,To record mistakes and review them to identify patterns and correct errors.,"at home. But when I do the test, it's like seven, 7.5. So they were getting really high scores in practice, lower scores on test day. I wasn't sure what this was and then I looked at their actual answers and multiple answers were spelled incorrectly, but they were giving themselves the correct answer. They're like, ah, it's just a little bit off. That doesn't matter. On the test, they're going to give you a incorrect answer for that. So be harsh and record your mistakes. Get yourself a notebook, just a plain notebook. Could be any sort of notebook you want and it doesn't matter how expensivejust a plain notebook. Could be any sort of notebook you want and it doesn't matter how expensive the notebookis the important thing is that you have just a blank notebook to record your mistakes. And then once you've finished doing all your practice, review it and you'll start to see patterns and then you can correct all your mistakes and that's really going to help you. Also, what you can do is when you make spelling mistakes, take a photo and take a photo of the mistakes, file it away in a folder on your iPhone or whatever, and you can then check it and then review your spelling mistakes and that's going to help you. Number four, it's not just a listening test. It is also a reading test, amuch, guys. If you enjoyed this video, please subscribe. We'll be making another one on Wednesday and another one on Friday, all about listening. Wednesday, we'll be looking at how to practice strategically. And on Friday, we'll focus on how to focus on the test and keep your focus during the test. Thank you very much, guys. Hope that you enjoyed that video. Let me know what you think about it in the comments. If you have any questions, let me know. Thank you. Bye bye.",YES,"

Explanation: The documents mention the importance of recording mistakes in a notebook, reviewing them to identify patterns, and correcting errors to improve test scores. This aligns with the answer provided"
"Besides listening, what other abilities does the listening test assess?","reading, thinking, spelling, grammar, and vocabulary.","that's going to help you. Number four, it's not just a listening test. It is also a reading test, a thinking test, a spelling test, a grammar test, and a vocabulary test. Testing all of these different things. I'd say these two are really, really important, reading and thinking. And this comes down to focus. Often you'll get students who are not used to listening to English and you have to listen for a very long time, and you don't think it's that long, but when you are there on test day, it does feel like a very long time. And it is a big challenge for a lot of people. And what happens ispeople speaking and one person speaking. For example, TED Talks, normally it's just one person speaking. That's going to be tested on the listening test. Podcasts or radio or TV could be one person. Most likely, it's going to be multiple people speaking. Testing different skills. Listening to one person and listening to multiple people, cutting in and stopping and asking questions in different accents, that's completely different from just listening to one person speaking. You should be listening to a range of topics, accents, and one person versus multiple people. Also, when you'reheadings, summary completion, but for each of the different types on the listening test, there are different types of questions. Each one tests a range of different skills and they all follow the same format. So if we go and have a look on my website, let's go to IELTS Listening. Must already be listening. So you'll see here, summary completion, form filling, multiple choice, labeling a map or plan. These are all very different types of questions and each of them requires a different strategy. So if we go to multiple choice here, it looks like three different types, common problems, strategy.get to Canada. Also countries like Australia, for example, has a point system for immigration, so the higher your score, the more points you're going to get. So getting a higher score in listening is really going to help you. And in general, just thinking a little bit strategically, you want to not be worrying so much about the listening test, because you're probably going to be worrying a lot about the writing test, maybe even the speaking test. And so if you have learned these things, which I'm about to teach you, and you've done all of these things, then you're going to make the whole test",NO,"

The answer provided is not fully supported by the documents. The documents mention that the listening test also includes a range of different skills such as listening to one person versus multiple people, different accents, and different types of questions like summary completion, form filling, multiple choice, and labeling a map or plan. While reading, thinking, spelling, grammar, and vocabulary are important skills, the documents emphasize the importance of various other skills and strategies for the listening test as well"
Why is improving vocabulary essential for reaching band 8?,"Improving vocabulary is essential for reaching band 8 because in order to improve your level, you're going to have to improve your vocabulary.","vocabulary. For many of you, it doesn't matter how many strategies or tips you listen to. If your vocabulary is not good enough, you're never going to get a band-aid for listening or reading. Think about what a band-aid means. A band-aid means that you're just below a native English speaker. So think about how the audacity that you have thinking that you're going to go from someone just learning a language to nearly native English speaker level by just learning some tips and tricks. That's outrageous to think that. In order to improve your level, you're going to have to improve yourtypes of questions, you know exactly what to do. And that's gonna mean that you can focus on getting the correct answer more. And they all follow the same format, so you can just learn that strategy and apply it.

No, you can't just do practice tests, you have to practice strategically. Because number one, it's not improving your score, but number two, it's wasting your time. If you did, lots of students that I speak to say, I've done all 13 of the IELTS, the Cambridge IELTS practice series, like that's a long time. For listening alone, that would be what, 40, 50outrageous to think that. In order to improve your level, you're going to have to improve your vocabulary. There's no other way around it. So number five, improve your vocabulary. Combine this with daily listening, daily reading practice. So if you're listening to a podcast, get your notebook, get a notebook that you just use for vocabulary.

Spelling is really, really important for IELTS listening for a few different reasons. Number one, normally people messimprove your spelling, active listening would mean that when you're listening to something and you hear a word that you're unsure of the spelling, you would write it down and then you would check the spelling in a dictionary and you would keep doing that until it improved your listening.

You can do that with your reading as well. When you're reading, try and improve your vocabulary by trying to note down new words and reviewing them. So record them in your book and review them regularly and that slowly but surely you're going to improve your vocabulary. You're not going to improve your vocabulary by looking at lists. You're not goingto help you. It doesn't help you understand the meaning of the word, how the word is used in a sentence, the grammar, the collocations, the synonyms, the antonyms.

When should you read the questions during the listening test?,You should be reading the questions before the recording starts.,"does feel like a very long time. And it is a big challenge for a lot of people. And what happens is you lose focus and then you don't read the questions. You don't think about what the answer might be. And then the listening track starts and you get lost and you get panicked and everything just snowballs and you're in a bad place. You should be reading the questions before the recording starts. You should be thinking about the questions. You should be thinking about what the answers might be before the recording starts. And that is really, really going to help you. Spelling, we've alsoall your questions. Last question was from somebody who said, why is section three really, really difficult? Well, the way that you should think about it is the first questions, not easy, but not very difficult. And the questions get more and more difficult as you go through the listening test. So a good way to think about it is the first section, the first easier questions, don't ignore those questions. Those are low hanging fruit. They're easy questions. Get those in the bank. And then that will enable you to go through the test and be very, very confident that you've got the answer toyour vocabulary. You're not going to improve your vocabulary by looking at lists.
