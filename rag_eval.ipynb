And I'm sure that there are hundreds of other ways that you could listen to English. If you live in an English-speaking country, go out and speak to people and listen to how people talk.

But very few students who I actually work with on a one-to-one basis, when they have a problem with listening, normally the first thing I say is, well, how many hours a day do you listen to English? Normally the answer comes back hours per day. I don't listen to even one hour per week. If you count up the number of minutes you spend eachday. I don't listen to even one hour per week. If you count up the number of minutes you spend each week listening, like I have lots of podcast apps on my phone and some of them are really cool. They can tell you how much you're listening.

It doesn't matter if it's very close or it's just two letters the wrong way, it's going to be wrong. And also be very harsh when you're practicing.

And that is really, really going to help you. Spelling, we've also covered. Grammar, there are certain types of questions where you're going to have to be aware of grammar. And if the grammar is not correct, you're going to get a wrong answer. Also being aware of grammar and thinking about grammar is going to help you predict the answer and get the correct answer ultimately.

I was working with one student a couple of weeks ago and they said to me, every time I do the test, I get like a seven or sorry, an eight or 8.5 when I'm practicing at home. But when I do the test, it's like seven, 7.5. So they were getting really high scores inat home. But when I do the test, it's like seven, 7.5.

Often you'll get students who are not used to listening to English and you have to listen for a very long time, and you don't think it's that long, but when you are there on test day, it does feel like a very long time. And it is a big challenge for a lot of people. And what happens ispeople speaking and one person speaking. For example, TED Talks, normally it's just one person speaking. That's going to be tested on the listening test. Podcasts or radio or TV could be one person. Most likely, it's going to be multiple people speaking. Testing different skills. Listening to one person and listening to multiple people, cutting in and stopping and asking questions in different accents, that's completely different from just listening to one person speaking. You should be listening to a range of topics, accents, and one person versus multiple people. Also, when you'reheadings, summary completion, but for each of the different types of, for on the listening test, there are different types of questions. Each one tests a range of different skills and they all follow the same format. So if we go and have a look on my website, let's go to IELTS Listening. Must already be listening.
