Today's live lesson is all about listening. So we've had a huge number of people emailing us over the past few months saying that they need a band 8 in listening. It seems that many, many people want to move to Canada, they need that 8777, and sometimes what's stopping them getting there is they're getting 7, 7.5 in listening, which is a great score. But if they had that 8 or even above 8 in the listening test, they would get to Canada. Also countries like Australia, for example, has a point system for immigration, so the higher your score, the more points you're going to get. So getting a higher score in listening is really going to help you. And in general, just thinking a little bit strategically, you want to not be worrying so much about the listening test, because you're probably going to be worrying a lot about the writing test, maybe even the speaking test.

And so if you have learned these things, which I'm about to teach you, and you've done all of these things, then you're going to make the whole test day a lot easier on you, because the less stress you have, the better. So the whole aim of this lesson is to give you things that actually work. First of all, I'm not going to give you any tips or tricks, because tips or tricks do not work. Tips or tricks, these are the best way to prolong your IELTS journey, to make it long, to make it hard, so that you will waste money. How much money is it these days to do the test? How much money are you wasting every time you fail the test?

You're not going to trick your way to go from a band seven to a band eight on the listening test. You're just not going to be able to do that. So none of the things I'm going to teach you today have to do with any tips or tricks. Why? They don't work. If they worked, I would tell you, but they don't. So number one, stop looking for tips and tricks. They do not work. Number two, listen to English every day. Now this sounds really, really obvious. This sounds like something that, you know, of course I'm going to do that. But very few students who I actually work with on a one-to-one basis, when they have a problem with listening, normally the first thing I say is, well, how many hours a day do you listen to English? Normally the answer comes back hours per day. I don't listen to even one hour per week. If you count up the number of minutes you spend each\"),\n",

If you count up the number of minutes you spend each week listening, like I have lots of podcast apps on my phone and some of them are really cool. They can tell you how much you're listening. I think the new iPhones or the new update for iPhone tells you how much time you spend on each app. And there's a lot of apps that do tell you that. If you add up all the time you spend listening to podcasts or YouTube or, you know, watching TED Talks, it's a lot less than you think. But it's so easy these days to listen to English every day because we carry it with us on our phone. So you could watch TV, you could listen to the radio, you could listen to podcasts, you could watch YouTube, you could listen to TED Talks.

The key here is not which TV show will help you improve your IELTS score or which podcast will help you improve your IELTS score or which TED Talks. It's about consistently doing it every single day. Ten minutes a day or 30 minutes a day or one hour a day is way more powerful and more impactful than panicking a week before your test and listening to 12 hours of podcasts or 12 hours of TED Talks a week before your test. It's not going to help you. And also the great thing about everything being on our mobiles, everything being on our phones is you can listen to this anywhere.

I just took the time just to sit and watch him play, but I could have been doing anything. There are multiple times per day where you have the time. Bring your phone with you. Bring your whatever you use to listen to and that's going to help you with that. If you want to get a Band-Aid, you should be listening to a range of different accents, a range of different topics.

Just keep it simple. Just do it and it will help you. Listen to a range of different topics. Obviously, podcasts have every single topic in the world. TED Talks have a great range of topics, especially topics that come up on the IELTS test. Have a look at those and they are going to help you. Also, look at multiple people speaking and one person speaking. For example, TED Talks, normally it's just one person speaking. That's going to be tested on the listening test. Podcasts or radio or TV could be one person. Most likely, it's going to be multiple people speaking. Testing different skills. Listening to one person and\"),\n",

You should be listening to a range of topics, accents, and one person versus multiple people. Also, when you're listening, we just did this lesson on Facebook before we did it here. There's a great question came up from one of the girls who was listening. She said that, I listen to podcasts for two hours every single day and my spelling is still terrible. I said, okay, what you need to do is actively listen. What does actively listen mean? For example, if you were terrible at spelling and you really needed to improve your spelling, active listening would mean that when you're listening to something and you hear a word that\"),\n",

Active listening is when you focus on one thing at a time and do something while you're listening. Let's say you wanted to improve your vocabulary. What you would do is listen to a podcast or something like that or YouTube or TED Talk. When you hear a word you don't know, write that word down, write all the information you need to remember that word and then review that word. Actively listening means you're doing something to help improve a specific area. That could be vocabulary, grammar, accent, pronunciation, all of these different things that you can focus on.

As I just said, you could focus on your spelling and actively listen to improve your spelling. Spelling is really, really important for IELTS listening for a few different reasons. Number one, normally people mess up spelling not because they are bad at spelling, it's because they're careless. They think about when you're writing an email or a text message to someone. Even as a native English speaker, I make spelling mistakes when I'm writing a text message or writing an email and it's not because I don't know the spelling of that word, it's because I'm not very careful when I'm doing that or I'm in a rush or I'm distracted or I'm not focused. What you need to do is make sure that you are, when you're transferring your answers over in the last part of the test, when you have that time at the end to transfer your\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'transcripts\\\\How_to_get_a_Band_8_in_IELTS_listening.txt'}, page_content=\"or I'm not focused. What you need to do is make sure that you are, when you're transferring your answers over in the last part of the test, when you have that time at the end to transfer your answers over, make sure your spelling is 100% spot on because if you get even one letter out of place, it is wrong. It doesn't matter if it's very close or it's just two letters the wrong way, it's going to be wrong. And also be very harsh when you're practicing. So when you are practicing, you're going to have to give yourself a score by checking your answers. Often when people check those answers, if the spelling is a little off, they'll give themselves a mark. They will tick it and they will give themselves that correct answer. You need to be realistic. You need to know your real score before you do the test. I was working with one student a couple of weeks ago and they said to me, every time I do the test, I get like a seven or sorry, an eight or 8.5 when I'm practicing at home. But when I do\"),\n",

I wasn't sure what this was and then I looked at their actual answers and multiple answers were spelled incorrectly, but they were giving themselves the correct answer. They're like, ah, it's just a little bit off. That doesn't matter. On the test, they're going to give you a incorrect answer for that. So be harsh and record your mistakes.

Number four, it's not just a listening test. It is also a reading test, a thinking test, a spelling test, a grammar test, and a vocabulary test. Testing all of these different things. I'd say these two are really, really important, reading and thinking. And this comes down to focus.

And then the listening track starts and you get lost and you get panicked and everything just snowballs and you're in a bad place. You should be reading the questions before the recording starts. You should be thinking about the questions. You should be thinking about what the answers might be before the recording starts. And that is really, really going to help you.

And also, as with the reading test, the most important thing is that you improve your vocabulary. For many of you, it doesn't matter how many strategies or tips you listen to. If your vocabulary is not good enough, you're never going to get a band-aid for listening or reading. Think about what a band-aid means. A band-aid means that you're just below a native English speaker. So think about how the audacity that you have thinking that you're going to go from someone just learning a language to nearly native English speaker level by just learning some tips and tricks.

Combine this with daily listening, daily reading practice. So if you're listening to a podcast, get your notebook, get a notebook that you just use for vocabulary. So you're listening to a podcast or a TED Talk or something, you hear a new word or phrase, write that down, add in what you're going to do, add in collocations, antonyms, synonyms, pronunciation, example sentences, and then at the end of six weeks, six months, you will have a huge number of new words which you can just go and review and you'll be improving your vocabulary and listening at the same time. You can do that with your reading as well. When you're reading, try and improve your vocabulary by trying to note down new words and reviewing them. So record them in your\"),\n",

You're not going to improve your vocabulary by noting down the translation to your own language. It's a waste of time. You will improve your vocabulary by listening out for new words, writing them down, and then reviewing them. Number six, have a strategy. There are many different types of questions. So you're probably more familiar with the reading questions like true, false, not given, multiple choice, matching headings, summary completion, but for each of the different types of, for on the listening test, there are different types of questions.

So you don't have to follow this exact strategy. You can come up with your own strategy, but the key is that you want to not become a robot on test day, but just do things automatically on test day.

And I really think a lot of you are going to benefit from that one on Wednesday. So let me see if there are any questions. First of all, stop talking and listen to Chris. He is giving us simple. Good, good advice. Yeah, because it's really difficult for me to find questions when all of you are just having little conversations. Yeah, I can't find most of the answers because...

Last question was from somebody who said, why is section three really, really difficult? Well, the way that you should think about it is the first questions, not easy, but not very difficult. And the questions get more and more difficult as you go through the listening test. So a good way to think about it is the first section, the first easier questions, don't ignore those questions.

Today's live lesson is all about listening. So we've had a huge number of people emailing us over the past few months saying that they need a band 8 in listening. It seems that many, many people want to move to Canada, they need that 8777, and sometimes what's stopping them getting there is they're getting 7, 7.5 in listening, which is a great score. But if they had that 8 or even above 8 in the listening test, they would get to Canada. Also countries like Australia, for example, has a point system for immigration, so the higher your score, the more points you're going to get. So getting a higher score in listening is really going to help you.

So the whole aim of this lesson is to give you things that actually work. First of all, I'm not going to give you any tips or tricks, because tips or tricks do not work. Tips or tricks, these are the best way to prolong your IELTS journey, to make it long, to make it hard, so that you will waste money. How much money is it these days to do the test?

This sounds like something that, you know, of course I'm going to do that. But very few students who I actually work with on a one-to-one basis, when they have a problem with listening, normally the first thing I say is, well, how many hours a day do you listen to English? Normally the answer comes back hours per day. I don't listen to even one hour per week.

But it's so easy these days to listen to English every day because we carry it with us on our phone. So you could watch TV, you could listen to the radio, you could listen to podcasts, you could watch YouTube, you could listen to TED Talks. And I'm sure that there are hundreds of other ways that you could listen to English. If you live in an English-speaking country, go out and speak to people and listen to how people talk.

On the way to work, on the way back from work, at lunch time, while you're looking after your kids, while they're doing something else, you can just have your podcast running in the background.

Just keep it simple. Just do it and it will help you. Listen to a range of different topics. Obviously, podcasts have every single topic in the world.

Listening to one person and listening to multiple people, cutting in and stopping and asking questions in different accents, that's completely different from just listening to one person speaking. You should be listening to a range of topics, accents, and one person versus multiple people. Also, when you're listening, we just did this lesson on Facebook before we did it here.

Active listening is when you focus on one thing at a time and do something while you're listening. Let's say you wanted to improve your vocabulary. What you would do is listen to a podcast or something like that or YouTube or TED Talk. When you hear a word you don't know, write that word down, write all the information you need to remember that word and then review that word.

That could be vocabulary, grammar, accent, pronunciation, all of these different things that you can focus on. One of those is spelling. As I just said, you could focus on your spelling and actively listen to improve your spelling. Spelling is really, really important for IELTS listening for a few different reasons. Number one, normally people mess up spelling not because they are bad at spelling, it's because they're careless. They think about when you're writing an email or a text message to someone. Even as a native English speaker, I make spelling mistakes when I'm writing a text message or writing an email and it's not because I don't know the spelling of that word, it's because I'm not very careful when I'm doing that or I'm in a rush or I'm distracted or I'm not focused.

It doesn't matter if it's very close or it's just two letters the wrong way, it's going to be wrong. And also be very harsh when you're practicing. So when you are practicing, you're going to have to give yourself a score by checking your answers. Often when people check those answers, if the spelling is a little off, they'll give themselves a mark. They will tick it and they will give themselves that correct answer. You need to be realistic. You need to know your real score before you do the test. I was working with one student a couple of weeks ago and they said to me, every time I do the test, I get like a seven or sorry, an eight or 8.5 when I'm practicing at home.

Number four, it's not just a listening test. It is also a reading test, a thinking test, a spelling test, a grammar test, and a vocabulary test. Testing all of these different things. I'd say these two are really, really important, reading and thinking. And this comes down to focus.

Good question, which book is useful for listening? You don't need a book for listening. You need\"),\n",

You need to listen for listening. A book is not really going to help you with listening. Any advice on multiple choice questions? Yeah, if you go to my website, go to, oops. So if you go to IELTS Listening. So if you go to the main homepage, you'll find writing, speaking, reading, listening, vocabulary. So you want help with listening. Just go in here and scroll down. So this is the listening guide and then multiple choice questions. Go in there, it's pretty simple. Okay. Okay. Will I be starting a $1 listening challenge? No, we're probably never going to do. I can say 100% we're never going to do a $1 listening challenge. And we probably will never do another $1 challenge ever again. Hopefully not. Good question. Should we learn explanation of words rather than translation? Yes, of course. Translation is not going to help you.\"),\n",

It doesn't help you understand the meaning of the word, how the word is used in a sentence, the grammar, the collocations, the synonyms, the antonyms. It's really a waste of time. Any good teacher, if you are in their classroom, they should ban, like just do not allow any translation. It should be 100% in English. Someone has asked five times how to answer multiple choice questions, and I took you through where to find it on the website. So maybe listen and watch. Okay. Thank you for all your questions. Last question was from somebody who said, why is section three really, really difficult? Well, the way that you should think about it is the first questions, not easy, but not very difficult. And the questions get more and more difficult as you go through the listening test. So a good way to think about it is the first section, the first easier questions, don't ignore those questions. Those are low hanging fruit. They're easy questions. Get those in the bank. And then that\"),\n",

And then that will enable you to go through the test and be very, very confident that you've got the answer to those questions. And then as you go through the end, don't worry if you get one or two wrong at the end, because even if you need a band aid, you can still get a few wrong and you're not looking for perfection. What happens with many students on the listening and the reading test is if they get any questions wrong, they get really angry with themselves and they think they're going to fail and say, well, add up all your marks. What mark did you get? Oh, a band aid. It's like, is band aid enough? Yes. But I want to get every question correct. You're not going to get every question correct. The key is to practice strategically. And we will look at that on Wednesday and I'll show you how you can learn from your mistakes and improve through practice. Thank you very much, guys.
